This is a proof-of-concept for learning purposes and is not meant for everyday use. It has only been tested on iOS so far.

## Running locally
```sh
npm i
npx react-native start
npx react-native run-ios # Run in the simulator
```

You'll most likely want to run this on-device to test the camera functionality: [React Native - Running on device](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device)
